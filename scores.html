    Black books are worth 300 points
    
    Jokers are worth 50 points
    
    2s are worth 20 points
    
    Aces are worth 20 points
    
    9s through Kings are worth 10 points
    
    4s through 8s are worth 5 points
    
    Going out is worth 100 points
    
      
    
    Points from the cards in the team’s remaining hand are deducted from the points from the team’s played cards.
