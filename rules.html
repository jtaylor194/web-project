                Hand and Foot is a popular variation from the rummy type game of Canasta. It can be described as a simpler, easier version of Canasta for beginners

                <small>Start</small>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of their turn they must take a card from either the stock or the discard pile. To take a card from the discard pile, the top card must either begin a meld or build upon one already made.
                     If you take from the discard pile, you must take all of the cards in the discard pile. At the end of your turn, you must discard one card.
                    Players must start with their Hand pile while their Foot pile is laid face down. Once the play all of the cards in their Hand pile, players move to their foot pile.
                </p>

                <small>Melding</small><br>
                <p>
                    Melds are formed by matching cards of the same rank. A meld must begin with at least 3 cards. Melds are shared within the teams so, teammates can build upon their own melds.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>Wildcards</small><br>
                <p>The Jokers and 2s in the deck are wildcards and can be used to build upon any meld. Melds must have, however, more natural cards than wildcards in them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <small>Books</small>
                <p>
                        In Hand and Foot, a pile of 7 cards is called a book.  If none of those cards are wild, it is called a red book. If any of the cards are wild, 
                        it is called a black book.  When books are made, the pile is tacked faced down and a card with the same color of the book is placed face up on top of the stack.

                <small>Going Out</small>
                <p>
                    Teams must have made a red book and a black book before they are allowed to “go out”.
                     They must also have played all of their cards in both their Hand and their Foot.
